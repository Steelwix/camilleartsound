                        <p>
                            For me, sound has always been about <strong>emotion</strong> first.
                            I don’t just hear things, I picture them, I feel them. When I’m out recording textures,
                            layering ideas, or just messing around with samples, I’m not trying to make something “clean”,
                            I’m trying to make something <strong>alive</strong>. Something that fits a world, a moment, or a feeling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What really clicks for me is when sound becomes part of the <strong>storytelling</strong>.
                            That’s why I naturally found my place in <strong>games</strong>.
                            It’s where I can shape atmosphere, rhythm, and space in ways that feel meaningful,
                            and actually matter to the experience.

                            I’ve worked on student projects, game jams, and indie games heading to Steam — each one taught me
                            something new about how to listen better, integrate smarter, and collaborate with devs.
                            I use tools like <strong>FMOD</strong>, <strong>Wwise</strong>, <strong>Unity</strong>,
                            <strong>Unreal</strong>… but honestly, the most important tool I’ve learned to rely on is
                            my own <strong>curiosity</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right now, I’m just looking for a team that cares about the details, about people,
                            and about building something that feels right — both in the game, and behind the scenes.
                            If that sounds like your vibe, I’d love to connect and share what I’ve been working on.

                        <h2>Shaping Sound, Exploring the World</h2>
                        <p>
                            I’m not here to make “good sound” — I want to make sound that <strong>feels like me</strong>.
                            Every sound I create has a bit of my personality in it. I spend a lot of time recording outside —
                            in the city, out in nature, or just chasing weird noises because I want my sounds to have life,
                            texture, and something a little different from what you usually hear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My biggest inspirations? Definitely <strong>Half-Life</strong>, <strong>Dead Space</strong>,
                            and <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong>. These worlds show how sound can be way more than background noise —
                            it <strong>shapes the whole vibe</strong> and tells its own story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I pull ideas from everywhere — movies, photos, random YouTube finds, documentaries, architecture,
                            even books and <strong>urbex trips</strong> I do with friends.
                            All that helps me build a richer, more real sound — not just something that works, but something that feels right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the end of the day, I don’t want my sound design to just blend in. <strong>I want it to belong.</strong>
                        </p>
