                    <p>
                        Sound has been a huge part of my life for years, but if I had to put a number on it, I’ve been fully dedicated to this craft for <strong>six years</strong>.
                        I draw inspiration from the media I consume, but it’s my <strong>imagination</strong> that truly shapes my creations, pushing me to explore new sonic landscapes.
                        I love <strong>venturing out, recording unique sounds, reshaping samples, and bringing new ideas to life</strong>. Every sound is an opportunity to <strong>craft something fresh, tell a story, and create a powerful atmosphere</strong>.
                        As a lifelong <strong>video game enthusiast</strong>, I’ve set my sights on making sound design my profession—<strong>building immersive worlds where every sound enhances the experience</strong>.
                        <strong>Check out my work and let the sound take you somewhere new.</strong>

                    <p>
                        For me, creating unique and personal sounds isn’t just a method—it’s something I truly need to do.
                        Every recording has its own character, its own texture, its own <strong>atmosphere</strong>.
                        That’s why I spend so much time capturing sounds, whether it’s out in nature, in the city, or in more unexpected places.
                        I love expanding my sound palette because every new sound has the potential to inspire something <strong>unique and powerful</strong>.
